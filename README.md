# Bone-Tumor-Analysis

We gathered a dataset of cancer patients that includes their gender, age, histological type, stage, current status, and treatment. After using pivot tables and charts to visualize the data, we arrived at the following conclusions:

1. The majority of affected patients are female.
2. The average age of affected male patients is significantly lower than that of female patients.
3. Radiotherapy and surgery are the primary treatments for patients.
4. Most patients have pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma histological type.
5. The thigh is the most common cancer location among patients.
